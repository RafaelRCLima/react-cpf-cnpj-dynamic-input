# react-cpf-cnpj-dynamic-input
A simple react solution for an unique field for both brazilian documents cpf and cnpj.

## How does this works
Just run 

```
npm start
```

or

```
yarn start
```

to see this input working

It uses a simple implementation with react-input-number and cpf-cnpj-validator combined with useState hook to change the masks between the two document types.
